# Privacy Policy

This placeholder explains how the Bitcoin Mining Feasibility Dashboard handles user data. Update it with the final legal language when available.

## Data collection
- Inputs entered into the dashboard stay within your Streamlit session unless you explicitly export them.
- No analytics or third-party trackers are enabled by default.

## Data retention
- Session data is transient and cleared when the browser tab is closed or the Streamlit session resets.
- Any exported files (e.g., PDFs) are stored where you choose to save them and are not retained by 21mScot.

## Third-party services
- Live BTC network data may be fetched from public APIs (e.g., CoinGecko, mempool.space). Requests include minimal metadata required to retrieve the data.

## Contact
For questions or formal privacy requirements, please contact the 21mScot team.
